RecruitUttarakhand.in is a web-based job portal developed by using Flask framework. The portal allowed applicants to easily search for job opportunities that match their skill set, location preferences, job type, company preferences, and salary expectations. In addition, we incorporated a search bar and filter options to provide applicants with a seamless and efficient job search experience.

The job portal also allows users to view a list of jobs they have applied for and the status of their application (accepted or rejected). Users can maintain their profile and edit their necessary details, as well as track their course progress. As part of the selection process, users are required to attempt a test provided by the employer, and they can revise the courses provided by the website before taking the test.The personal interview round is a crucial factor in deciding a candidate's suitability for the job profile. Our real-time interviewing system allows the company to conduct interviews from anywhere. The system offers face-to-face interviews or a chat room for convenience. Additionally, students can answer a random set of interview questions and submit the interview in audio/video format.

One of the most innovative features of our job portal was the integration of NLP (Camelot library) in the backend. This technology allowed for the automatic extraction of tables and text from uploaded resumes in pdf or doc format. The extracted data was then populated into tabular form with the relevant fields, thereby eliminating the need for employers to manually review each resume line by line. This process saved both time and effort for the employers, enabling them to focus on more critical aspects of the hiring process.

Overall, our web-based job portal with NLP integration provided a user-friendly and efficient solution for job seekers and employers alike, streamlining the job application process and saving valuable time for all parties involved.
